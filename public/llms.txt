## Products & Services

### Cellular Shades (Honeycomb Shades)

The most energy-efficient window covering available. Honeycomb air-pocket cells act as insulation directly at the window, reducing heat loss in Northern Idaho winters (single-digit temperatures) and heat gain in summers (90°F+). Available in single, double, and triple-cell options; light-filtering to full blackout; cordless and motorized. Top-down/bottom-up options preserve lake and mountain views while insulating the lower portion of the window.

Mark's expert recommendation: 3/4-inch double cell is the sweet spot for most Northern Idaho homes — substantial insulation without looking bulky.

### Solar Shades

Engineered to reduce glare and block UV rays while maintaining outward visibility — like sunglasses for your windows. Available in openness factors from 1% (maximum blockage) to 14% (maximum view). Darker fabric colors provide better outward visibility and superior glare reduction. Best for lake-facing homes in Coeur d'Alene and Sandpoint, south and west-facing windows, and home offices.

Mark's expert recommendation: Dark charcoal 5% openness for lake-view windows — cuts water glare while keeping the view crystal clear.

### Roller Shades

Sleek, minimal profile with a wide range of fabrics from completely sheer to total blackout. Premium textures available including linen, woven, and metallic finishes. Available in spring-loaded, chain, or motorized operation. Precision measurement is critical — even 1/4 inch off is immediately visible with roller shades. Popular in newer construction in Post Falls, Rathdrum, and Hayden.

### Banded Shades (Zebra Shades / Dual Shades)

Alternating horizontal bands of sheer and solid fabric on a continuous loop. Aligning solid-to-solid provides full privacy. Aligning sheer-to-sheer filters light beautifully while maintaining the view. Modern aesthetic popular in new construction with open floor plans. Lafayette and Norman brands use tension systems that maintain band alignment long-term — the difference from budget versions is immediately obvious.

### Roman Shades

Fabric-based shades with elegant horizontal pleats that fold neatly when raised. Wide selection of premium fabrics, textures, and patterns. Flat fold style recommended for most modern and transitional homes — cleaner, ages better. Blackout lining available. Works beautifully in craftsman and lodge-style homes common to Northern Idaho. Fabric choice is critical — Mark recommends bringing samples into the actual room at different times of day.

### Plantation Shutters

Permanent architectural upgrade custom-built to exact window specifications. Adds real estate value — consistently cited by real estate professionals as a feature buyers notice and value. Available in premium hardwood (beautiful, not recommended for high-humidity areas) and engineered composite (moisture-resistant, ideal for bathrooms). Louver sizes: 2.5", 3.5", and 4.5". Requires the most precise measurement of any window treatment — Northern Idaho's freeze-thaw cycles cause window frames to shift out of square, and Mark's experience accounts for this.

### Motorized Window Treatments

Control via remote, smartphone app (iOS/Android), or voice assistant (Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit — brand dependent). Battery-powered motors require no hardwiring for most installations. Whisper-quiet motors last 1–2 years on a single charge. Programmable schedules tied to sunrise/sunset. Group control available for multiple shades in one room. Mark handles complete setup, programming, and smart home integration.

Available for: cellular shades, roller shades, Roman shades, banded shades.

## Expert Knowledge: Northern Idaho Window Treatment Considerations

- **Energy efficiency**: Northern Idaho has extreme seasonal temperature swings. Cellular shades are practically a necessity for homes with single-pane windows or large unprotected glass.
- **Lake glare**: Homes on Lake Coeur d'Alene and Lake Pend Oreille (Sandpoint) deal with intense reflected glare from the water. Dark-fabric solar shades in 5% openness are the most effective solution.
- **Freeze-thaw window shift**: The freeze-thaw cycle causes window frames to move slightly out of square over time. This affects shutter installation most significantly — precision measurement that accounts for out-of-square frames is essential.
- **Large windows in new construction**: Post Falls, Rathdrum, and Hayden have seen significant new construction with soaring ceilings and large windows. Motorization is popular here for hard-to-reach windows and automated convenience.
- **Humidity in bathrooms**: Real wood shutters can warp in bathrooms. Composite shutters or moisture-resistant roller shades are the right choice for wet areas.

## Common Questions Answered

**Q: What window treatments are best for energy efficiency in Northern Idaho?**
A: Cellular shades (honeycomb shades) are the most energy-efficient option available. The air-trapping honeycomb structure provides insulation directly at the window. Double-cell in 3/4-inch is the sweet spot for most Northern Idaho homes.

**Q: Do plantation shutters add home value?**
A: Yes. Real estate professionals consistently identify plantation shutters as a window treatment buyers notice and value. They are a permanent architectural feature — unlike fabric treatments that depreciate after installation.

**Q: Do motorized shades require hardwiring?**
A: No. Battery-powered motors from Alta, Norman, and Lafayette require no hardwiring and are installed in a single visit. Motors last 1–2 years per charge. For new construction, Mark recommends running power to window frames for hardwired motors that never need battery changes.

**Q: What is the difference between 1% and 14% openness in solar shades?**
A: Lower openness percentage = more blockage of light and glare, less view through the fabric. A 1% is nearly opaque. A 14% is very open with minimal blockage. For most Northern Idaho lake-view windows, 5%–10% is the right balance.

**Q: How does pricing work for custom window treatments?**
A: Mark provides exact pricing after a free in-home consultation and measurement. Custom window treatments are priced per window based on size, product type, fabric/material selection, and any motorization. No surprises — everything is quoted upfront before any order is placed.

**Q: Can I get motorized shades that work with Alexa or Google Home?**
A: Yes. Alta, Norman, and Lafayette all offer motorized options compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple HomeKit. Mark confirms compatibility with your specific smart home system during the consultation.

**Q: How long does installation take?**
A: Most residential window treatment installations are completed in a single visit. Mark handles the measurement appointment and the installation appointment separately. Typical lead time from order to installation is 2–4 weeks depending on the product.
