<p>When homeowners see "Made in USA" on window treatments, they think American craftsmanship, American jobs, and American quality standards. After nearly two decades in this industry, I've watched how that label works in practice versus how consumers think it works—and the gap is bigger than most people realize.</p>
<p>The window covering industry has become particularly skilled at appearing domestic while operating very differently behind the scenes. Federal labeling regulations create significant room for interpretation, trade agreements blur geographic boundaries, and strategic marketing language suggests American origin without technically claiming it.</p>
<p>For consumers paying premium prices based on assumptions about where and how products are manufactured, understanding what "Made in USA" actually means—and doesn't mean—matters more than marketing departments want you to know.</p>
<h2><strong>The Trust Gap: Consumer Expectations vs. Industry Reality</strong></h2>
<p>The FTC requires that products advertised as "Made in USA" be "all or virtually all" made in the United States, meaning final assembly, significant processing, and virtually all components must be domestic. That sounds straightforward until you examine how it's applied in practice.</p>
<p>Most American consumers don't realize that when window covering companies reference North American manufacturing, they often include Mexican production facilities in that definition. The average homeowner purchasing Hunter Douglas or Springs products based on perceived American quality doesn't consider Mexican assembly to fall under "Made in USA"—but federal regulations and industry practices frequently do.</p>
<p>This creates a fundamental disconnect between what consumers think they're buying and what they're actually getting. They believe they're supporting American manufacturing and American workers. In reality, they're often purchasing products assembled or manufactured across the border, with that reality carefully obscured by strategic marketing language.</p>
<p>The disconnect isn't accidental—it's built into how the industry operates, markets itself, and structures supply chains. Unless you're deep inside manufacturing operations or supply chain management, you'd never recognize the difference from product catalogs or showroom displays.</p>
<h2><strong>How Labeling Loopholes Actually Work</strong></h2>
<p>The FTC's "all or virtually all" standard requires that final assembly or processing occur in the U.S., all significant processing goes into the product in the U.S., and all or virtually all ingredients or components are made and sourced domestically. However, "manufacturing costs" and "significant processing" can be interpreted broadly enough to create substantial wiggle room.</p>
<h3><strong>Assembly vs. Manufacturing</strong></h3>
<p>A critical distinction exists between "assembled in USA" and "manufactured in USA," though most consumers don't recognize the difference. A product can be labeled "Assembled in USA" if components are put together domestically, even if major parts are imported.</p>
<p>Complex window treatments might incorporate motors from Asia, fabrics from various countries, hardware from Mexico, and control systems from Europe—but if final assembly happens in a U.S. facility, the labeling can suggest predominantly American origin. The question becomes: what percentage of the actual manufacturing value occurred domestically versus what percentage happened during final assembly?</p>
<h3><strong>USMCA and North American Trade Blurring</strong></h3>
<p>The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, formerly NAFTA) enables Mexico-based manufacturing to operate under North American trade frameworks that further blur origin distinctions. Products manufactured entirely in Mexico can be marketed using language like "North American manufacturing" or "Made with U.S. and imported parts" that sounds more domestic than it actually is.</p>
<p>For consumers who assume "North American" means "American," this phrasing creates exactly the impression companies intend—without technically violating labeling requirements.</p>
<h3><strong>Strategic Marketing Language</strong></h3>
<p>Companies strategically deploy phrases like "North American Assembly," "Designed in USA," "U.S. and Imported Components," or "Assembled in America" to suggest American manufacturing without making claims that would require full domestic production. These phrases satisfy legal requirements while creating consumer impressions that may not match manufacturing reality.</p>
<p>The average homeowner shopping at a local dealer or big-box retailer doesn't parse these distinctions carefully enough to understand what they actually mean.</p>
<h2><strong>Case Study: Hunter Douglas Manufacturing Reality</strong></h2>
<p>Hunter Douglas provides the clearest example of this labeling complexity in practice. The company operates a significant manufacturing facility in Agua Prieta, Mexico, handling production for products sold throughout the U.S. market. Yet Hunter Douglas maintains premium positioning based partly on perceived American quality and engineering heritage.</p>
<p>Since 3G Capital's acquisition in 2022, Hunter Douglas has closed multiple U.S. facilities and shifted production to Mexico, including relocating operations from McKinney, Texas to Agua Prieta, impacting 100 workers, and closing plants in Sacramento, California, Jacksonville, Florida, and Cumberland, Maryland.</p>
<p>The contradiction is stark: marketing products as premium and implicitly American while systematically moving manufacturing offshore to reduce costs. For consumers paying $800-1,500 for motorized cellular shades based on Hunter Douglas's reputation and assumed American manufacturing standards, the reality of Mexican production represents a significant disconnect between expectation and actual origin.</p>
<p>This connects directly to Hunter Douglas's dual-channel strategy. When manufacturing costs are minimized through offshore production, it becomes easier to compete on price through value channels (like 3 Day Blinds) while maintaining premium margins in independent dealer networks—all while suggesting comparable quality regardless of actual manufacturing location or process.</p>
<h2><strong>Case Study: Springs Window Fashions Brand Segmentation</strong></h2>
<p>Springs Window Fashions operates a particularly strategic dual-brand approach that highlights industry labeling practices. Graber targets premium dealer channels with messaging emphasizing quality and craftsmanship. Bali serves big-box retail with value positioning and competitive pricing.</p>
<p>Both brands benefit from cross-border production capabilities that reduce manufacturing costs while maintaining different market positioning and price points. Graber commands premium pricing partly because consumers associate the brand with higher manufacturing standards and superior materials—even when production methods and component sourcing may be substantially similar to value-oriented Bali products.</p>
<p>This brand segmentation allows Springs to optimize manufacturing costs across their entire portfolio while maintaining premium messaging where it supports higher margins. Consumers purchasing Graber products through independent dealers may assume they're receiving superior American manufacturing compared to Bali products from Home Depot or Lowe's, when actual production differences may be minimal or nonexistent.</p>
<p>The strategy works because most consumers don't research manufacturing origins deeply enough to understand these operational realities—and companies have no incentive to clarify the situation.</p>
<h2><strong>The Companies That Actually Commit to Domestic Manufacturing</strong></h2>
<p>In an industry where "Made in USA" often means something different than consumers expect, a few companies genuinely commit to American manufacturing as more than marketing messaging.</p>
<h3><strong>Lafayette Interior Fashions: Authentic American Manufacturing</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.lafvb.com" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.lafvb.com">https://www.lafvb.com</a></p>
<p>Lafayette Interior Fashions, founded in 1950 by Joe Morgan Sr., remains family-owned and operated today, with over 500 employees manufacturing custom window coverings in their 250,000 square foot facility in West Lafayette, Indiana. The company's commitment to U.S. manufacturing isn't just marketing—it's embedded in their operations, their workforce, and their supply chain decisions across three generations of family leadership.</p>
<p>When Lafayette says "Made in USA," they mean traditional American manufacturing with American workers in American facilities using predominantly domestic materials. The company inspects raw materials for quality assurance before manufacturing, then designs and crafts custom products domestically.</p>
<p>Lafayette's approach demonstrates that genuine American manufacturing remains viable for companies willing to prioritize long-term reputation over short-term cost reduction. They've chosen to invest in domestic production capabilities rather than chase offshore savings—and they've built dealer trust by matching their operational reality to their marketing claims.</p>
<h3><strong>Norman Window Fashions: Expanding U.S. Production</strong></h3>
<p>Norman Window Fashions presents an interesting case study in authentic domestic commitment. Despite overseas ownership, Norman has actually expanded their U.S. manufacturing footprint with facilities in California and South Carolina rather than following industry trends toward offshore production.</p>
<p>Norman's approach demonstrates that ownership structure doesn't automatically determine manufacturing philosophy. They've chosen to invest in American production not just because it sounds good in marketing materials—but because it supports quality control, dealer relationships, and warranty fulfillment in ways that offshore manufacturing cannot replicate.</p>
<p>Both companies understand that in a market full of labeling complexity and mixed messages, dealer trust and authentic origin stories create competitive advantages that justify the investment in domestic operations.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Manufacturing Origin Actually Matters</strong></h2>
<p>The disconnect between marketing claims and manufacturing reality creates real problems throughout the supply chain—for consumers, dealers, and ultimately for industry credibility.</p>
<h3><strong>Quality and Consistency</strong></h3>
<p>Manufacturing location directly affects quality control, component consistency, and warranty fulfillment. Domestic facilities typically maintain tighter quality standards because they operate under direct management oversight rather than through third-party contractors or offshore partnerships. When problems arise—and they always do—domestic manufacturing enables faster response, better communication, and more accountability.</p>
<h3><strong>Warranty Support Reality</strong></h3>
<p>Warranty fulfillment becomes significantly more complex when products are manufactured offshore but marketed as premium American quality. Getting replacement parts, arranging remakes, or troubleshooting installation issues becomes slower and more difficult when the actual manufacturing facility is in Mexico rather than the United States—regardless of what the marketing materials suggest.</p>
<h3><strong>Dealer Relationships and Trust</strong></h3>
<p>Dealers who tell the truth about sourcing and manufacturing locations can win competitive advantages in markets full of half-truths and strategic ambiguity. Customers appreciate honest explanations about where products actually come from, why manufacturing location matters for quality and service, and what warranty support will actually look like when problems occur.</p>
<p>Transparency about manufacturing origins, assembly processes, and supply chain realities builds the kind of trust that survives beyond the initial sale. When motor systems fail after 18 months or fabric quality doesn't match expectations, customers remember whether their dealer was honest about what they were actually purchasing.</p>
<h2><strong>What Homeowners Should Actually Ask</strong></h2>
<p>When shopping for window treatments, asking the right questions can cut through marketing language to understand what you're actually buying.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this specific product manufactured?</strong> Don't accept "North American" or "U.S. and imported parts" as answers. Ask specifically: what percentage is manufactured domestically versus assembled from imported components? If the dealer doesn't know, that's information in itself.</p>
<p><strong>What does your warranty actually cover, and who handles claims?</strong> Understanding whether warranty fulfillment goes through the dealer, the manufacturer, or a third-party service company tells you a lot about how responsive support will be when problems arise.</p>
<p><strong>Can you show me products from companies with genuine U.S. manufacturing?</strong> Dealers who carry Lafayette, Norman, or other authentically domestic lines can explain the actual differences in quality control, component consistency, and warranty support compared to brands using offshore manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>What's your experience with quality and warranty issues on this brand?</strong> A dealer who's been working with specific brands for years can tell you whether remake rates have increased, whether warranty claims get approved promptly, and whether product quality has changed under new ownership.</p>
<h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Does "Made in USA" always mean 100% American manufacturing?</strong></h3>
<p>No. The FTC's "all or virtually all" standard allows for minimal foreign content if it's negligible, but there's no bright-line percentage rule. Products can contain some imported components and still qualify for unqualified "Made in USA" claims if those components are minor and final assembly plus significant processing occur domestically.</p>
<h3><strong>What's the difference between "Made in USA" and "Assembled in USA"?</strong></h3>
<p>"Assembled in USA" is a qualified claim appropriate when major components are imported but final assembly occurs domestically. It's legally distinct from unqualified "Made in USA" claims and suggests significant foreign content. Most consumers don't recognize this distinction, which is exactly why companies use it.</p>
<h3><strong>Does "North American manufacturing" mean American manufacturing?</strong></h3>
<p>Not necessarily. "North American" typically includes Mexico and Canada under USMCA trade frameworks. Companies use this phrasing strategically to suggest U.S. manufacturing without technically claiming it, knowing most American consumers equate "North American" with "American."</p>
<h3><strong>Why do premium brands manufacture in Mexico?</strong></h3>
<p>Cost reduction. Labor, facilities, and regulatory compliance cost significantly less in Mexico than in the United States. For private equity-owned companies focused on maximizing margins and financial returns, offshore manufacturing offers substantial cost advantages—even if it conflicts with the premium American quality positioning they market to consumers.</p>
<h3><strong>How can I find window covering companies with genuine U.S. manufacturing?</strong></h3>
<p>Ask dealers specifically about manufacturing locations and look for companies that explicitly state domestic production rather than using ambiguous language. Lafayette Interior Fashions and Norman Window Fashions both commit to U.S. manufacturing. Independent regional fabricators often maintain domestic operations as well. The key is asking directly and not accepting vague "North American" answers.</p>
<h3><strong>Does U.S. Customs labeling tell me where a product was made?</strong></h3>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection requires that imported products be marked with foreign country of origin, but if a product undergoes "substantial transformation" in the U.S., it may not require foreign origin marking. However, just because Customs doesn't require foreign origin marking doesn't automatically mean the product qualifies for "Made in USA" claims under FTC standards. The agencies use different criteria.</p>
<h2><strong>Tips from Mark: Understanding Manufacturing Reality</strong></h2>
<ol><li><strong>Read labels literally, not emotionally.</strong> "Assembled in USA" is not the same as "Made in USA." "North American manufacturing" includes Mexico. "Designed in USA" tells you nothing about where it's actually produced. Companies choose these phrases deliberately to create impressions without making claims they can't support.</li>
<li><strong>Recognize that premium pricing doesn't guarantee domestic manufacturing.</strong> Hunter Douglas commands premium prices while shifting production to Mexico. Springs brands like Graber maintain high-end positioning regardless of manufacturing location. Price point and brand reputation don't reliably indicate where products are actually made.</li>
<li><strong>Ask dealers about their experience with specific brands' warranty support.</strong> Dealers who've been in business for years can tell you whether warranty claims get approved promptly, whether remake rates have increased, and whether customer service quality has declined. This real-world experience matters more than catalog promises.</li>
<li><strong>Understand that ownership changes affect manufacturing decisions.</strong> When private equity firms acquire window covering brands, cost reduction becomes a priority even if it conflicts with historical reputation. If a brand you trusted five years ago has changed ownership, verify that manufacturing standards haven't changed along with it.</li>
<li><strong>Support companies that actually commit to domestic manufacturing.</strong> If genuine American manufacturing matters to you, seek out companies like Lafayette Interior Fashions that have maintained domestic operations across decades and ownership transitions. Your purchasing decisions signal what you value—companies respond to that feedback.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Building Trust Through Transparency</strong></h2>
<p>In an industry where labeling can be misleading and marketing messages often obscure operational realities, transparency becomes a genuine competitive advantage. Consumers are increasingly sophisticated about researching products and companies before making significant home improvement investments. When they discover that "Made in USA" doesn't mean what they thought it meant, it damages trust across the entire industry.</p>
<p>The most successful dealers and manufacturers long-term will be those who match their marketing messages to their operational realities, rather than maximizing the gap between consumer perception and manufacturing truth. Honesty about where products come from, why manufacturing location matters for quality and service, and what consumers should actually expect creates the kind of trust that survives beyond the initial sale.</p>
<p>Consumers care about authenticity. They're paying attention to these details. And they deserve to know the difference between genuine American manufacturing and strategic labeling that suggests one thing while delivering another.</p>
