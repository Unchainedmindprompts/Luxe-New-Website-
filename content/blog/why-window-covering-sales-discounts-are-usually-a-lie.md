<p>I'm going to tell you something that might make you mad. But you deserve to hear it.</p>
<p>That "70% off" sale the national franchise is running? It's a lie. The "free shop card" your warehouse club offers? You're paying for it—every penny. And that sweaty, rushed feeling you get when a window covering salesperson shows up at your door with a three-ring binder and a "manager I need to call"? That's manufactured pressure, designed to separate you from your money before you have time to think.</p>
<p>I spent 22 years in this industry. I've worked for the big names, the franchises, the "we're everywhere" brands. And I've watched good people—hardworking North Idaho families—get played by pricing games that would embarrass a used car lot.</p>
<p>Here's the truth: Most window covering companies don't show you their real price first. They show you a fake one. Then they "discount" it. Then they make you feel like you're getting a deal when, in reality, you're getting taken.</p>
<p>At Luxe Window Works, we decided to burn that playbook. We give you our best price every single time—no games, no pressure, no manager phone calls. Because in Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls, your word still means something. And so should ours.</p>
<p>Let me show you exactly how the industry manipulates you—and why we refuse to play along.</p>
<hr /><h2>The Pressure Cooker: Why Your In-Home Window Consultation Feels Like a Negotiation</h2>
<p>Let me paint you a picture.</p>
<p>You schedule an appointment with a national window covering company. Maybe you saw their truck around town. Maybe they ran a big ad. You're excited—new shades for the living room, maybe some shutters for the bedroom. You've been thinking about it for months.</p>
<p>The rep shows up. Nice enough person. But within ten minutes, something feels… off.</p>
<p>They're moving fast. Really fast. They measure your windows, flip through a catalog, talk about features you didn't ask about. Then comes the quote. And it's <em>high</em>. Like, way higher than you expected. Your stomach drops a little.</p>
<p>But wait—today's your lucky day. They just happen to be running a promotion. If you sign <em>right now</em>, they can take 50% off. Maybe even 60%. But only if you decide today. They pull out their phone. "Let me call my manager and see if I can get you an even better deal."</p>
<p>You sit there, uncomfortable. You weren't planning to decide today. You wanted to think about it. Maybe get another quote. But now you feel like if you don't say yes, you're walking away from thousands of dollars in savings.</p>
<p>That feeling? That knot in your chest? That's not buyer's excitement. That's <strong>high-pressure sales tactics</strong> doing exactly what they're designed to do—force a decision before you're ready.</p>
<p>This is the "Act Now or Lose the Deal" close. And it's everywhere in the window covering industry.</p>
<p>Here's what they don't tell you: That "50% off" price? It's probably close to what they were willing to sell for all along. The inflated starting price exists <em>only</em> to create urgency. To make you feel like you're getting a deal when you're really just getting pushed.</p>
<p>And the "manager call"? That's theater. That manager isn't negotiating. They're following a script. The discount was pre-approved. The whole performance is designed to make you feel like you squeezed out a win, when in reality, you just paid what they wanted you to pay.</p>
<p>I've watched this play out hundreds of times. And every single time, I've thought the same thing: <em>This customer deserves better.</em></p>
<p>You're not a mark. You're not a commission check. You're a homeowner trying to make a smart decision for your family. And you shouldn't have to feel like you're negotiating a hostage release just to get a fair price on roller shades.</p>
<hr /><h2>The Myth of the 70% Sale: Unmasking Franchise Discount Gimmicks</h2>
<p>Let's talk about that "70% off" sale you keep seeing.</p>
<p>You've seen the mailers. The online ads. "Buy One, Get One Free!" "70% Off All Cellular Shades!" "Limited Time: Up to 60% Off!"</p>
<p>Sounds incredible, right? Like if you don't act now, you're leaving a massive amount of money on the table.</p>
<p>Here's the secret: <strong>The starting price is a lie.</strong></p>
<p>Let me explain how this works, because once you see it, you can't unsee it.</p>
<p>Most big franchise operations use what I call "phantom pricing." They create an artificially inflated "regular price" that no one ever actually pays. It exists solely to make the "sale price" look like a screaming deal.</p>
<p>Here's a real-world example. Let's say a cellular shade actually costs the company $150 to make, ship, and install, and they want to make a 40% margin. A fair retail price might be around $250.</p>
<p>But they don't show you $250.</p>
<p>They show you $600. Then they "discount" it by 60%. Now you're paying $240. You walk away thinking you saved $360. You feel like you won.</p>
<p>But that $600 price? It never existed. No one has ever paid $600 for that shade. The $600 is a psychological anchor—a fake number designed to make $240 feel like a steal, even though it's basically the fair market price.</p>
<p>This is <strong>price inflation</strong>, and it's <em>rampant</em> in the franchise discount model.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission actually has rules against this—it's called false reference pricing. But enforcement is weak, and the practice continues because it works. People <em>love</em> feeling like they got a deal, even when they didn't.</p>
<p>Think about it like those "MSRP" prices you see on furniture or mattresses. The manufacturer's suggested retail price is often double or triple what anyone actually pays. It's a made-up number. It's there to create the illusion of value.</p>
<p>In the window covering world, this is standard operating procedure for the big guys. And it's disrespectful. It assumes you won't do the math. It assumes you'll get so excited about the discount percentage that you won't question whether the starting price was ever real.</p>
<p>At Luxe Window Works, we start with the real price. The one we can stand behind. The one that reflects fair cost, fair labor, and fair margin. No inflation. No fake "MSRP." Just honest pricing you can trust from day one.</p>
<p>Because in North Idaho, we still believe a handshake should mean something.</p>
<hr /><h2>The Costco Conundrum: Analyzing the Illusion of Added Value</h2>
<p>Okay, let's tackle the big one: the Costco offer. Or Lowe's. Or Home Depot. Or any of those "get a $200 shop card with your window covering purchase" deals.</p>
<p>On the surface, it sounds awesome. You're already buying the shades—why not get a $200 gift card on top of it? Free money, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Here's how the <strong>Costco shop card gimmick</strong> actually works.</p>
<p>Let's say a cellular shade costs $250 from an independent dealer. That's the fair price—materials, labor, overhead, profit.</p>
<p>Now, a big national brand partners with Costco. They offer the same shade for $300—but you get a $200 Costco card with your purchase.</p>
<p>Net cost to you? $100 out of pocket, plus $200 you're "getting back" to spend at Costco. Feels like a $50 discount, right?</p>
<p>Except it's not.</p>
<p>That $200 card isn't free money. It's <em>your money</em>. The company raised the price by at least $200 (often more) to cover the cost of that card. You're not getting a bonus—you're getting your own cash back, in a form that forces you to spend it at one specific retailer.</p>
<p>It's a psychological trick. The card <em>feels</em> like added value. But mathematically, it's a wash. You paid more upfront, and you got some of it back in store credit. Meanwhile, the company pocketed the difference, and Costco got a guaranteed customer.</p>
<p>I'm not saying these companies are evil. I'm saying the pricing model is deliberately misleading. It's designed to obscure the true cost and make you <em>feel</em> like you're winning when you're really just paying full freight—or more.</p>
<p>And here's the kicker: You can't compare prices easily. When one company quotes $250 cash and another quotes $450 with a $200 card, which is cheaper? You have to do mental math. You have to assign value to that card (which you may or may not have used otherwise). The confusion is the point.</p>
<p>At Luxe Window Works, we don't do shop cards. We don't do rebate gimmicks. We don't make you jump through hoops or spend your "bonus" at a partner retailer. We just charge you a fair price and let you spend your money however you want.</p>
<p>Radical concept, I know.</p>
<hr /><h2>The Luxe Way: Straightforward Pricing Built on Respect for Your Intelligence</h2>
<p>So if everyone else is playing games, why don't we?</p>
<p>Because we live here. We work here. We see you at the grocery store. Our kids might go to school with your kids. And in Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls, reputation isn't just marketing—it's everything.</p>
<p>We built Luxe Window Works on a simple idea: <strong>Treat people the way you'd want to be treated.</strong></p>
<p>That means no pricing games. No fake discounts. No pressure. No shop card tricks. Just honest, transparent pricing from the first conversation.</p>
<p>Here's how it works.</p>
<p>When you schedule a consultation with Luxe, we come to your home. We measure your windows. We talk about your goals—light control, privacy, energy efficiency, style. We show you options. We answer your questions. And then we give you a quote.</p>
<p>That quote is our best price. Not the "sale price" or the "if you sign today price." It's the real price. The one we can stand behind tomorrow, next week, or next month.</p>
<p>You don't have to decide on the spot. You don't have to play negotiation games. You don't have to wonder if you're getting taken. Because the price we give you is the price we'd give our own family.</p>
<p>This is what we call a <strong>no-pressure consultation</strong>. It's consultative, not transactional. Our job is to educate you, help you understand your options, and give you the information you need to make a confident decision. Not to close you before you leave the driveway.</p>
<p>Why do we do it this way?</p>
<p>Because you're smart. You've done your research. You're not looking for the cheapest option—you're looking for the <em>best</em>option. The one that solves your problem, fits your budget, and comes from a company you can trust.</p>
<p>And trust isn't built with discount gimmicks. It's built with honesty.</p>
<p>We know that in a small market like ours, word of mouth is everything. If we treat you right, you'll tell your neighbors. If we play games, you'll tell them that too. So we choose to do business the old-fashioned way: with integrity.</p>
<p>Our "Best Price Every Time" guarantee isn't just a slogan. It's a commitment. It means you can trust that the number we give you is fair, competitive, and honest. No games. No regrets.</p>
<hr /><h2>Luxe Window Works Q&amp;A: Addressing the Price Anxiety</h2>
<p>I know what you're thinking. This all sounds great, but how do I <em>know</em> I'm getting a good deal if there's no sale?</p>
<p>Let me answer the three questions I hear most often.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If you don't offer sales, how do I know I'm getting a good deal?</strong></p>
<p>A: Because our pricing is based on real costs, not inflated anchors. When we quote you $250 for a shade, that's the fair market price—not a "sale price" marked down from an imaginary $600. You can compare our quotes directly with any competitor's <em>final</em> price (not their starting price), and you'll see we're competitive. But more importantly, you'll see we're consistent. The price we give you today is the same price we'd give you next month. That's transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does your "best price" include installation?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. Every quote we provide includes professional measurement, custom fabrication, and expert installation. No hidden fees. No surprise add-ons. The price you see is the price you pay. We've been doing this too long to nickel-and-dime you at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why is a price given in person, not online?</strong></p>
<p>A: Because every window is different. The size, the depth, the mounting surface, the light conditions—these all affect the product recommendation and the final cost. We could give you a ballpark estimate online, but it wouldn't be accurate. And inaccurate pricing is just another form of gamesmanship. We'd rather measure once, quote once, and get it right. That's respect for your time and ours.</p>
<hr /><h2>Mark's Pro Tips for Navigating the Window Covering Minefield</h2>
<p>Whether you choose us or not, you deserve to shop smart. Here are three things I tell every homeowner who's buying window treatments:</p>
<p><strong>Tip #1: Always ask for the base price without the sale discount applied.</strong></p>
<p>If a company tells you the shades are "$800, but on sale for $400," ask them point-blank: "What would I pay for these next month if the sale is over?" If they won't tell you, or if they say "We're always running a sale," you're looking at price inflation. Walk away.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #2: Compare final quotes, not advertised discount percentages.</strong></p>
<p>A "70% off" sale means nothing if the starting price is made up. Focus on the bottom line. What are you actually paying out of pocket? That's the only number that matters. Ignore the theater.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #3: Never sign on the first visit if you feel pressured.</strong></p>
<p>Any company that respects you will give you time to think. If they're pushing you to decide today—"This price is only good if you sign now"—that's a red flag. A confident company doesn't need to rush you. Take the quote home. Sleep on it. Get a second opinion. A good deal will still be a good deal tomorrow.</p>
<hr /><h2>Conclusion: Choose Peace of Mind Over Pricing Games</h2>
<p>Look, I get it. Shopping for window treatments is already stressful. You're trying to balance style, function, and budget. The last thing you need is to feel like you're being played.</p>
<p>That's why we built Luxe Window Works the way we did. Just honest pricing, expert advice, and a commitment to treating you the way we'd want to be treated.</p>
<p>In Coeur d'Alene and Post Falls, your word still means something. So does ours.</p>
<p>If you're tired of the games and ready for a straightforward, no-pressure consultation, we'd love to earn your trust.</p>
