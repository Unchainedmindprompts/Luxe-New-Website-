<p data-start="439" data-end="689">If you’re shopping for window coverings in Coeur d’Alene, Post Falls, Hayden, Rathdrum, or Sandpoint, you probably have the same handful of questions everyone asks—about pricing, timelines, energy efficiency, and what the process actually looks like.</p>
<p data-start="691" data-end="773">Here are the most common questions we hear at Luxe Window Works, answered clearly.</p>


<hr data-start="775" data-end="778" />

<h3 data-start="780" data-end="822">Q: Do you have a showroom I can visit?</h3>
<p data-start="823" data-end="1064"><strong data-start="823" data-end="829">A:</strong> We’re an in-home service—<strong data-start="855" data-end="887">we bring the showroom to you</strong>. During your free consultation, we bring curated samples, review options in your lighting, take exact measurements, and help you compare choices that fit your style and budget.</p>


<hr data-start="1066" data-end="1069" />

<h3 data-start="1071" data-end="1110">Q: Is the consultation really free?</h3>
<p data-start="1111" data-end="1307"><strong data-start="1111" data-end="1117">A:</strong> Yes. Your in-home consultation is free and includes style guidance, sample viewing, and measurements. If you decide to move forward, we’ll place your custom order and schedule installation.</p>


<hr data-start="1309" data-end="1312" />

<h3 data-start="1314" data-end="1352">Q: Are window coverings expensive?</h3>
<p data-start="1353" data-end="1634"><strong data-start="1353" data-end="1359">A:</strong> They don’t have to be. We offer <strong data-start="1392" data-end="1420">options for every budget</strong>, from simple roller shades and faux wood blinds to premium woven textures, shutters, and motorized solutions. We’ll show you “good / better / best” options and explain the trade-offs so you can choose confidently.</p>


<hr data-start="1636" data-end="1639" />

<h3 data-start="1641" data-end="1696">Q: What’s the difference between blinds and shades?</h3>
<p data-start="1697" data-end="1705"><strong data-start="1697" data-end="1703">A:</strong></p>

<ul data-start="1706" data-end="2019">
 	<li data-start="1706" data-end="1789">
<p data-start="1708" data-end="1789"><strong data-start="1708" data-end="1718">Blinds</strong> have slats you can tilt for light control (ex: faux wood, aluminum).</p>
</li>
 	<li data-start="1790" data-end="2019">
<p data-start="1792" data-end="2019"><strong data-start="1792" data-end="1802">Shades</strong> are a continuous fabric (ex: roller, cellular/honeycomb, Roman, woven wood).<br data-start="1879" data-end="1882" />If you want a clean modern look, shades are often the go-to. If you want adjustable light control and privacy, blinds can be a great fit.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr data-start="2021" data-end="2024" />

<h3 data-start="2026" data-end="2102">Q: What’s the best window covering for energy efficiency in North Idaho?</h3>
<p data-start="2103" data-end="2399"><strong data-start="2103" data-end="2109">A:</strong> For most homes here, <strong data-start="2131" data-end="2162">cellular (honeycomb) shades</strong> are the top choice for efficiency. They’re designed to help insulate windows—reducing heat loss in winter and helping rooms stay cooler in summer. We’ll also look at sun exposure, glass type, and room function to choose the best option.</p>


<hr data-start="2401" data-end="2404" />

<h3 data-start="2406" data-end="2443">Q: Do you offer motorized shades?</h3>
<p data-start="2444" data-end="2713"><strong data-start="2444" data-end="2450">A:</strong> Yes—<strong data-start="2455" data-end="2484">motorization is available</strong>, but it’s not required. Many clients still choose manual options. If you want motorized shades, we’ll help you choose the right system (remote, wall switch, or smart home integration) and make sure it’s reliable and easy to use.</p>


<hr data-start="2715" data-end="2718" />

<h3 data-start="2720" data-end="2758">Q: How long does the process take?</h3>
<p data-start="2759" data-end="2990"><strong data-start="2759" data-end="2765">A:</strong> After your consultation and final selections, most custom orders take time to manufacture and ship. We’ll give you a clear timeline upfront and keep you updated. Installation is typically fast and clean once product arrives.</p>

We measure, order through trusted manufacturers, and <strong data-start="3099" data-end="3125">professionally install</strong> what you choose. Proper measurement and installation are what make custom window coverings look “right” and work smoothly long term.</p>


<hr data-start="3260" data-end="3263" />

<h3 data-start="3265" data-end="3329">Q: Can you do just one window, or do you only take big jobs?</h3>
<p data-start="3330" data-end="3468"><strong data-start="3330" data-end="3336">A:</strong> We do both. Whether it’s one room or the entire house, we’ll treat the project with the same level of care and attention to detail.</p>


<hr data-start="3470" data-end="3473" />

<h3 data-start="3475" data-end="3525">Q: What window coverings are best for privacy?</h3>
<p data-start="3526" data-end="3619"><strong data-start="3526" data-end="3532">A:</strong> It depends on the room and how much light you want. Popular privacy solutions include:</p>

<ul data-start="3620" data-end="3868">
 	<li data-start="3620" data-end="3699">
<p data-start="3622" data-end="3699"><strong data-start="3622" data-end="3653">Top-down / bottom-up shades</strong> (great for bathrooms and street-facing rooms)</p>

 	<li data-start="3764" data-end="3868">
<p data-start="3766" data-end="3868"><strong data-start="3766" data-end="3782">Sheer shades</strong> (privacy with a higher-end look)
We’ll recommend the best option based on your goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr data-start="3870" data-end="3873" />

<h3 data-start="3875" data-end="3940">Q: What’s the best option for sliding doors or large windows?</h3>
<p data-start="3941" data-end="3973"><strong data-start="3941" data-end="3947">A:</strong> Common solutions include:</p>

<p data-start="4060" data-end="4197"><strong data-start="4060" data-end="4071">Drapery</strong> (soft, high-end, great for insulation)
We’ll match the solution to how you use the door and how much stacking space you have.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr data-start="4199" data-end="4202" />

<h3 data-start="4204" data-end="4256">Q: How do I know what will look best in my home?</h3>
<p data-start="4257" data-end="4483"><strong data-start="4257" data-end="4263">A:</strong> That’s exactly why we bring samples to you. Seeing fabrics and finishes in your lighting, next to your floors and wall color, makes the decision much easier—and helps you avoid costly “looks different at home” mistakes.</p>
