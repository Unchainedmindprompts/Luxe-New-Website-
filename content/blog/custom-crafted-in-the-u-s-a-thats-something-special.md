<p><strong>By Mark Abplanalp, Owner of Luxe Window Works</strong></p>
<p>It makes me smile every time we receive a new shipment of window treatments from Lafayette Interior Fashions. Every box carries the same small but powerful detail — a <strong>“Custom Crafted in America”</strong> sticker. It’s a reminder that behind every product we install is a team of skilled craftspeople right here in the United States, building something with care, precision, and pride.</p>
<p>At Luxe Window Works, we represent manufacturers who share our values: quality, precision, and real craftsmanship. That's why we proudly partner with Lafayette Interior Fashions—a family-owned company that's been building custom window treatments right here in the United States since 1950.</p>

<hr /><h2><strong>Why American-Made Matters</strong></h2>
<p>When you choose Lafayette Interior Fashions through Luxe Window Works, you're not just buying window treatments—you're investing in a legacy of quality and accountability that spans over seven decades.</p>
<h3><strong>Craftsmanship Rooted in West Lafayette, Indiana</strong></h3>
<p>Lafayette Interior Fashions operates from a 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in West Lafayette, Indiana, where every custom product is designed and crafted. The company was founded in 1950 by Joe Morgan Sr., who started in a one-room garage taking orders on Mondays, crafting products on Wednesdays, and hand-delivering them on Fridays. That same commitment to quality remains central to their operation today.</p>
<p>Lafayette remains one of the few family-owned and operated window covering manufacturers in the United States, now run by Joe Morgan Sr.'s children and grandchildren. When a company stays in the family for three generations, you know they're doing something right.</p>
<h3><strong>Quality Control That Starts Before Production</strong></h3>
<p>Lafayette inspects new raw materials for quality assurance before placing them on shelves, and every step from sales and customer service to production and shipping involves coordinated teamwork. This isn't an assembly line churning out generic products—it's a deliberate process where pride shows up in every seam, every hem, and every precisely measured panel.</p>
<h3><strong>Supporting American Jobs and Local Sourcing</strong></h3>
<p>Lafayette Interior Fashions employs over 500 people across 40 states, meaning your purchase supports domestic jobs at every level—from the sales team to the factory floor. Raw materials are sourced with the same attention to quality, and the entire supply chain benefits from U.S. labor standards and ethical manufacturing practices.</p>
<h3><strong>True Customization—Built to Your Exact Specifications</strong></h3>
<p>"Custom" isn't a marketing term at Lafayette—it's a production standard. Every blind, shade, shutter, and drapery panel is built specifically for your window dimensions, your fabric choices, your hardware selections, and your motorization preferences. There's no cutting corners or settling for "close enough."</p>
<hr /><h2><strong>What This Means for Northern Idaho Homeowners</strong></h2>
<p>Living in Coeur d'Alene, Post Falls, Sandpoint, or anywhere in the Inland Northwest comes with specific window treatment challenges. Lafayette's U.S.-based manufacturing delivers real advantages for our region.</p>
<h3><strong>Precision Fit for Northwest Windows</strong></h3>
<p>Northern Idaho homes range from historic Craftsman cottages to modern lakefront estates—and every window presents unique dimensions and installation challenges. Lafayette builds to the exact measurements we provide, down to the eighth of an inch. That precision matters when you're covering large picture windows, angled transoms, or awkwardly sized openings that don't follow standard sizing charts.</p>
<p>When treatments are manufactured overseas, there's often a margin of error built into the process. We've seen it: shades that are a half-inch too short, blinds that don't sit flush in the frame, or drapery panels that miss the floor by just enough to look off. Lafayette eliminates that guesswork because they build each piece as specified—no approximations, no generic sizing.</p>
<h3><strong>Durability for Our Climate</strong></h3>
<p>Idaho winters are cold. Summers bring intense UV exposure, especially near the lake. Lafayette's cellular shades, wood blinds, and fabric treatments are engineered to handle temperature swings, high UV conditions, and the dry indoor air that comes with running a furnace for months on end.</p>
<p>Materials matter. Domestic manufacturing gives Lafayette access to higher-quality components and fabrics that hold up better over time compared to budget imports. We've installed Lafayette products in homes where treatments have performed flawlessly for 10, 15, even 20 years—still operating smoothly, still looking sharp.</p>
<h3><strong>Reliable Lead Times You Can Plan Around</strong></h3>
<p>One of the biggest frustrations with overseas manufacturing is unpredictable delivery windows. Shipping delays, customs holds, and supply chain bottlenecks can push timelines by weeks or even months. Lafayette manufactures domestically, which means more predictable production schedules and faster turnaround when you need it.</p>
<p>For homeowners coordinating installations with remodels, new construction, or staging a home for sale, that reliability is critical. We can give you a realistic timeline and stick to it.</p>
<h3><strong>Local Service Backed by National-Quality Manufacturing</strong></h3>
<p>When you work with Luxe Window Works, you get our local expertise combined with Lafayette's national infrastructure. If there's ever a service issue—a broken cord, a motorization glitch, a fabric defect—we have direct access to Lafayette's customer service and parts department. That's a huge advantage over trying to navigate warranty claims with a faceless overseas supplier or a big-box retailer with no real manufacturer relationship.</p>
<h3><strong>Broad Product Range—From Classic to Cutting-Edge</strong></h3>
<p>Lafayette offers a complete line of custom treatments:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Blinds:</strong> Wood, faux wood, aluminum, and vertical blinds in dozens of finishes and slat sizes</li>
<li><strong>Shades:</strong> Roller shades, cellular shades, sheer shadings, woven woods, and Roman shades</li>
<li><strong>Draperies:</strong> Soft treatments in hundreds of fabric options, with custom pleating, lining, and hardware</li>
<li><strong>Motorization:</strong> Somfy-compatible systems for whole-home automation and smart integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you're covering a wall of south-facing glass or dressing up a bedroom with layered fabric panels, Lafayette has the product depth to match your vision and your budget.</p>
<hr /><hr /><h2><strong>What "Made in the USA" Really Means for You</strong></h2>
<p>Let's cut through the marketing noise. Here's what choosing Lafayette Interior Fashions through Luxe Window Works actually delivers:</p>
<h3><strong>Quality You Can See and Feel</strong></h3>
<p>Materials are better. Construction is tighter. Finishes are cleaner. When you touch a Lafayette product, it feels substantial—not flimsy or cheaply made. That quality translates into longevity, which means fewer replacements and better long-term value.</p>
<h3><strong>Accountability and Transparency</strong></h3>
<p>When issues arise, there's a clear chain of responsibility. You're working with a local installer (Luxe Window Works) who has a direct relationship with a U.S.-based manufacturer (Lafayette). No offshore customer service loops, no language barriers, no runaround.</p>
<h3><strong>Supporting Local and National Economies</strong></h3>
<p>Your dollars stay closer to home. Lafayette employs hundreds of Americans, sources materials domestically when possible, and contributes to the U.S. manufacturing sector. That matters—not just philosophically, but economically.</p>
<h3><strong>Peace of Mind from Start to Finish</strong></h3>
<p>From initial consultation to final installation to long-term service, the entire process is smoother and more reliable. You get accurate timelines, predictable outcomes, and ongoing support if anything needs attention down the road.</p>

<hr /><h2><strong>Common Questions About Lafayette Interior Fashions</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>How "custom" is custom?</strong></h3>
<p>Every Lafayette product is built to your exact window measurements—down to the eighth of an inch. You choose the style, material, color, lift system, and motorization options. There are no pre-made sizes or "close enough" approximations. If your window is an odd shape, oversized, or non-standard in any way, Lafayette builds to fit.</p>
<h3><strong>What are typical lead times?</strong></h3>
<p>Most Lafayette orders are completed and ready to install within 3–4 weeks from the time we submit your order. Complex treatments like custom draperies or specialty motorized systems may take slightly longer, but we'll give you a clear timeline upfront. These lead times are far more predictable than overseas manufacturing, where delays can stretch for months.</p>
<h3><strong>Can Lafayette handle wide or odd-shaped windows?</strong></h3>
<p>Absolutely. Lafayette specializes in custom solutions for challenging window configurations—oversized picture windows, angled transoms, arched openings, bay windows, and more. If it's a window, Lafayette can cover it. We'll take precise measurements and work directly with their production team to ensure a perfect fit.</p>
<h3><strong>Why choose Lafayette over a big-box imported brand?</strong></h3>
<p>Big-box stores typically offer a limited selection of imported, semi-custom products with inconsistent quality control and minimal post-sale support. Lafayette offers true customization, superior materials, better craftsmanship, and direct manufacturer support. You're also working with a local installer (Luxe Window Works) who stands behind the installation and can handle service requests without navigating corporate call centers or overseas suppliers. The difference in long-term performance and satisfaction is significant.</p>
<h3><strong>Does Lafayette offer motorization?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. Lafayette partners with Somfy, a leading motorization brand, to offer both wired and wireless motor options. Their motorized treatments integrate seamlessly with popular smart home platforms like Control4, Lutron, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home. Whether you want remote control convenience, voice activation, or full home automation, Lafayette has a solution that works.</p>
<h3><strong>Are Lafayette products more expensive than imports?</strong></h3>
<p>Lafayette's pricing is competitive for the quality and customization you receive. While you might find cheaper options at big-box stores, those products typically lack the precision fit, durability, and long-term performance of Lafayette treatments. When you factor in longevity, fewer repairs, and better resale value, Lafayette products often deliver better overall value. We're happy to discuss pricing and options during your consultation.</p>
<hr /><h2><strong>Mark's Top 5 Tips for Choosing American-Made Window Treatments</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Prioritize Precision Fit Over "Close Enough"</strong></h3>
<p>Northern Idaho homes—especially older or custom-built properties—rarely have standard window sizes. Lafayette's true custom manufacturing means every treatment is built to your exact measurements, eliminating gaps, uneven hems, and installation headaches. If your windows are oversized, angled, or irregularly shaped, don't settle for generic sizing. Custom fit matters, and it shows in both function and appearance.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Think Long-Term Durability, Not Just Upfront Cost</strong></h3>
<p>It's tempting to choose the cheapest option, but window treatments are a long-term investment. Lafayette's materials and construction quality mean treatments that perform reliably for 10–20 years without sagging, fading, or mechanical failure. Cheaper imports often need replacement within 3–5 years, which costs more over time. Ask yourself: do you want to deal with this project again in a few years, or do you want it done right once?</p>
<h3><strong>3. Consider the Climate You're In</strong></h3>
<p>Idaho's temperature swings, dry winters, and intense summer UV exposure are tough on window treatments. Lafayette's products are engineered with higher-quality fabrics, UV-resistant finishes, and durable hardware that hold up in our climate. If you're covering large south- or west-facing windows, choose materials specifically rated for high UV and insulation performance. Lafayette's cellular shades, for example, are excellent for energy efficiency in cold climates.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Work with a Local Installer Who Knows the Manufacturer</strong></h3>
<p>Big-box stores subcontract installations to whoever's available, and if there's a problem, good luck getting support. When you work with Luxe Window Works, you're working with an authorized Lafayette dealer who has a direct relationship with the manufacturer. That means faster service, easier warranty claims, and someone local who stands behind the work. Don't underestimate the value of accountability.</p>
<h3><strong>5. If Motorization Is in Your Future, Plan for It Now</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you're not ready to motorize every window today, consider choosing treatments that can be upgraded later. Lafayette's motorization options integrate cleanly with smart home systems, and planning for it during the initial installation saves money and hassle down the road. At minimum, make sure your power and control setup can accommodate future motorization if you decide to add it.</p>
